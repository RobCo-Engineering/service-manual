# Painting and Weathering

One of the many ways you can customise your device is to remove the weathering
and optionally repaint the device altogether. In this short guide we will cover
the few stages to attempt this and show off an example. Because of how its
applied the stock weathering will probably rub off over time, particularly in
areas that are handled a lot, so you may wish eventually to reapply it. At the
bottom of this guide ill add a small section on how to do that.

## Removing the stock weathering

The Pip-boy comes with a layer of black "grime" added around the device to give
an illusion of the device having been through a wasteland. This applied effect
we think is watered down acyrlic paint, it can be removed very easily. To remove
it simply use a clean lint-free cloth and some rubbing alcohol, you could also
in theory even use vodka or gin. **Whatever you do do not use acetone or paint
thinners as they may strip the silver paint from the abs plastic body.** Heres
an example of a Pip-boy thats had its weathering removed:

## Adding custom weathering

I asked a member of our community S15Costuming about the process they used to
weather their device and they kindly provided us with pictures and a description
of the process:

**"First, I cleaned up the stock weathering that The Wand Company used with
Rubbing Alcohol, then I used acrylic paints, mainly from Vallejo's Rust, Stain,
and Streaking kit to start weathering and staining, trying to focus on spots
that would be rusted the most, such as areas where water, dirt, and grime would
gather. I also used a mix of watered down acrylic paints to "dirty up" the
screen, mainly focusing on the edges of the screen. I used rubbing alcohol and
water to thin it out to make it not look like I just threw down blotches of
paint. I had to keep cleaning and reapplying paint to get it to a state where I
was happy with the weathering."**

process**

## Completely repainting the device (full coverage)

You can if you wish completely repaint the outer shell of the device. In order
to do this youll need to use masking tape to cover anywhere you dont want to
repaint and remove the cushions, make sure you dont forget to mask off the cable
too. Once you're ready youll want to cover the entire shell with an even coat or
two of a primer, followed by a coat or two of your colour of choice. If you have
a dual primer and colour spray that might work too. Spray paint is definitely
reccomended here for even coverage a brush would struggle to achieve.

## Reapplying the stock weathering

Even if you dont want to completely repaint or weather yout device you may want
to add back some of the stock weathering. To achieve this you can water down
black acrylic in a 2:1 paint to water ratio (possibly thicker like a 3:1 if you
want more persistent grime) and brush some on. Make sure you keep water away
from the dials and buttons and once the paint has been on for about 10-20
seconds use some tissue or a paper towel to wipe some of it off. You can also
just brush the paint and water mix into the nooks and crannies around the body
and leave it overnight to dry.
